# stanford-cs106b
My work as I go through Stanford's CS106B, Programming Abstractions course.

Used videos from SEE:
https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B/143

Library Documentation:
https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/cppdoc/

After assignment one I switched to the programming assignments on the newer course. Many of the concepts are the same but they are compatible with the new libraries.

For those resources (slides, starter code for assingments, etc) you can go here (link will take you to latest course):
